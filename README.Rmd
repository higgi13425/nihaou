The goal of nihaou is to provide functions to calculate Social Determinants of Health summary scores for the NIH All of Us Research Program.

## Installation

You can install the development version of nihaou from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("higgi13425/nihaou")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem,
calculating the neighborhood disorder score for a survey data frame:

```{r example}
library(nihaou)
## basic example code
calc_disorder(fake_survey_df)

```

# Usage
With a survey data frame from the NIH AllofUs Research Program, you can calculate the Social Determinants of Health summary scores within your workspace with the following functions:

- calc_cohesion()
- calc_density()
- calc_disorder()
- calc_spa()

There are only 4 functions built so far, and each of them has one working test. To be able to calculate all of the scores, we will need another 17 functions or so.
